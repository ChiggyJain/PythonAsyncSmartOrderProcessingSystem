Python Async Smart Order Processing System built using FastAPI, asyncio, Redis, and Kafka.
Implements real-world order validation, inventory management, and Redis-backed state tracking with async patterns.
Uses AIOKafka for fully async event-driven processing with main, retry, and DLQ consumer workers.
Supports resilient order lifecycle: received → validated → dispatched → processed with automatic retries.
Demonstrates production-grade backend skills across async architecture, microservices, messaging, caching, and distributed workflows.
